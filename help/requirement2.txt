1. user registration

	a. user fills a form
		in form we have fields as
			name
			age
			gender
			email
			password

	b. user will click on submit button

	c. after clicking on submit button, POST /users/register API will be called with all of the user data

	d. Inside nodejs server,  /users/register API route will call controller function.

	e. inside controller function
		we should check if email already exists in UserModels, if yes 
			then throw error saying email is already register and status code 400

		if no then proceed

		we should covert password string to hash using bcrypt library

		we should save all of the data inside the User Model in mongodb

		we should return 200 status code with message 
		"user created succesfully"

	f. UI/reactjs will show response of the /users/register API
		if it is error,	 then show error message

		if it is success, then show success message



user login
1. form filled and call API
	email and password
2. inside controller
	1. first we check if user exists or not in database
	2. to compare password with the hash that we have saved in database
	3. to create a jwt token with userId, name and email
	4. send 200 status code with token
3. we save this token in reactjs




jwt token

why to do we need this token ?
	to achieve authentication ?

    
GET /cart/getProduction 

we need to send 
user data in the API
	using tokens

 	directly send the email

	[
		smartwatch1,
		smartwatch2
	]


my session gets expires
	=> token is expired 


nodejs stateless  

REST API are stateless
